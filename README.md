# Agency Program Requirements

DRAFT repo for forthcoming [MDS 1.2.0](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/governance/wiki/Release-1.2.0).

A place for city/governmental agencies to store and link to their MDS program [Policy Requirements](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/tree/ms-requirements/policy#requirement) documents, hosted by the OMF.

Each agency that chooses to host a public, referenceable file here can place it in the [/requirement](/requirement) folder.

Additions and updates to files can be made by opening an issue, creating a PR, or contacting the OMF. Changes to the file are automatically tracked. OMF Staff is responsible for final approvals and ensures the files are valid.
