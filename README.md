# Agency Program Requirements

A place for city/governmental agencies to store and link to their MDS program [Policy Requirements](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/tree/ms-requirements/policy#public-hosting) documents, hosted by the OMF, as documented in the [MDS 1.2.0](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/governance/wiki/Release-1.2.0) release.

See the [Policy Requirements - OMF Hosting Guidance](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/wiki/Policy-Requirements-OMF-Hosting-Guidance) document for more details, and our guide for (Adding an MDS Agency ID)[https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/wiki/Adding-an-MDS-Agency-ID].

Each agency that chooses to host a public, referenceable file here can place it in the [/requirement](/requirement) folder, or host it themselves.

Additions and updates to files can be made by [opening an issue](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/agency-program-requirements/issues), [creating a PR](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/agency-program-requirements/pulls), or [contacting the OMF](https://www.openmobilityfoundation.org/get-in-touch/). Changes to the file are automatically tracked. OMF Staff is responsible for final approvals and ensures the files are valid.
