# Agency Requirements

A place for city agencies to store and link to their MDS program [Policy Requirements](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/tree/ms-requirements/policy#requirement) documents, hosted by the OMF.

Each agency that chooses to host a public, referenceable file here can place it in the [/requirement](/requirement) folder.

Additions and updates to files can be made by opening an issue, creating a PR, or contacting the OMF. Changes to the file are automatically tracked. OMF Staff is responsible for final approvals and ensures the files are valid.
